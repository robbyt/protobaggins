# What/Who is Proto Baggins?

A collection of simple and reusable Golang helper functions that I use when working with Protocol
Buffers in Golang.

# Why does this exist?

Because I want a central place for all the useful conversion and workflow stuff. There might be a
better way to do these things.

# What is this name?

Proto Baggins traveled across the land to deliver serialized data to the great mountain of gRPC.
